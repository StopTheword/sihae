## About

I'm Joe Haines, a software developer at [Mayden](http://www.mayden.co.uk/) where I work on [**iaptus**](http://www.iaptus.co.uk/), a patient management and reporting solution for psychological therapists.

I like to build things; mostly in PHP and JavaScript but I've used &mdash; or made todo list apps in &mdash; all sorts of languages.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/imjoehaines) and email me at [hello@joehaines.co.uk](mailto:hello@joehaines.co.uk)
